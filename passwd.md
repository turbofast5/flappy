# Passwords

Remembering passwords is a part of modern life—even if you
never become a programmer. Developing your own system for remembering
them reliably is an essential requirement. Forgetting a password
can cost you and the class 10 minutes or more as we attempt to
restore it and contact your parents to do it.  ***Even worse, a
forgotten GitHub password can lock out an entire class.***

If you regularly forget your password in Fundamentals you really
need to return to Prep until have managed to work out a way not to
forget.

## Strategies

Beyond memorizing passwords or even having them all be the same, which
rarely works for a long time, consider creating a notebook or piece of
paper that you bring with you to class, or take a picture of it with
your phone. Don't forget a backup.

## Google Password Recovery

The most important password of all is your Google/Gmail password.
All other passwords can be recovered by opening  up your email and
resetting from the email sent to you. But if you can't open your Gmail
you are really stuck.

Therefore, when you create a Gmail make sure to fill in the phone
number and alternative email parts so that there is always a backup
in you forget even your Gmail. Make sure you keep this information
current, say, for example, when you or your parents get a new phone.
Make sure the latest is in there.
