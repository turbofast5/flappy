# Using Chrome Incognito

Chrome is the browser we use during this course. Incognito
(in-cog-NEE-to) is a way to use Chrome so that the person before
you or after you is not affected by what you do. The creators of
CodeCombat.com recommended that we use this to avoid having one
student do levels for the one before. We have found this works for
a lot of things, codeanywhere.com, codeacademy.com, piskelapp.com,
khanacademy.com and many more—especially that use Google+ or GitHub
for logins. So here's how to do it.
