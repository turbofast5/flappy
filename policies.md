# Policies

Blah, blah. Yeah, I know. Policies are lame. But it is kinda important
that you—and more importantly—your parents understand them. 

## Payment

All payment is due in advance by the posted deadline, no exceptions.
Deadlines are listed on your location's web site and calendar.
Most all forms of payment are accepted but require a bit more to cover 
fees when using credit of any kind. For example, $612 instead of
$600 when using credit cards. Rather than simply requiring all to
pay by cash or check this gives parents a financing alternative.
No other financing options are provide beyond this. Students
can earn up to full tuition in rebates working on staff as teacher
assistants and such if they qualify and are selected.

## Strikes

Students automatically agree to the [student pledge](pledge.md) when
they register. Violations of the pledge, as judged by the instructor
and/or the location manager, will be counted as strikes. Three strikes
and students are immediately removed from SkilStak with no refund.
A strike can be cleared after one year without any additional strikes.

Strikes for the school are more severe and are different than
[strikes for Pro](http://github.com/skilstak/pro).

## No Refunds

No refunds will be given. Decisions about whether to have a given
course are based on registration numbers not changing. **When in
doubt apply for less or don't apply at all.** We want committed
students who will seek opportunities to work on stuff even outside
of class and who would rarely miss a week and even then only for
extreme exceptions.

In exceptional cases—with written approval from the location
manager—tuition paid that would otherwise be lost can be used **up
to a year** from that date for other programs for which the student
may still be eligible or given to another family member or student
currently still enrolled in the school or to a new applicant.

## First Paid, First Registered

All courses require full payment to reserve a place in that course.
Courses do and will fill far before the registration/payment deadline.
Watch the calendar to keep track of how courses are filling.

## Three Students Minimum Required to Hold Course

Courses with less than three enrolled at the beginning of the
semester will be canceled and the money returned if another suitable
class is not available.

## Makeups

We understand students will have to miss occasionally for sickness,
weather, or other conflicts. We offer up to (but not more than) two
makeups up to two weeks from the time of the first missed class.
In other words, **all makeup opportunities expire two weeks from
the date of the missed class**. Students can either attend the
same course at a different time in addition to their regular course
or can arrange to make up material during the time of a different
course.

**All makeups require 48 hour advanced notice by email to [your
location's email
address](communications.md#enrollment-and-makeups-use-email) to
attend** in order to arrange for the proper number of teacher
assistants and such. **Makeups are never as good as classes because
multiple courses are represented in the lab.** When in doubt call
or ask first.

## Loss of Eligibility

As unpleasant as it is to discuss it is important students and
parents understand that **we reserve the right to deny any
application or withdraw enrollment eligibility from any student for
any reason at any time with no refund**. This is very rare and every
effort is made to ensure such students are not accepted into the
school in the first place.

Students who become abusive, physical, harassing, disrespectful,
or distract others from learning in any way, who regularly lose
focus, who fail to complete projects, or who require more than one
assistant per three students to meet their attention needs will not
be eligible for continued enrollment. In severe cases parents will
be called to immediately remove the former student from the school.

We have the somewhat unique privilege to ensure only those
that are willing to learn and help are in the school. For the good
of those students contributing and learning we will not hesitate
to take immediate action when needed to maintain the best possible
learning environment.

## Parent Visits

We welcome and encourage visits from parents to monitor any class
in which their student is enrolled. However, due the size or our
classrooms and in order to not overbook too many monitoring parents
at a time we require at least one week (7-days) advanced notice by
email.

## Communications

Parents and student are responsible to ensure they understand
and use the [communications methods described
separately](communications.md).
